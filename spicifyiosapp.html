      <h5>Overview</h5>
      <p>
        Spicify is an iOS app that is intended for beginner home- cooks to
        identify Indonesian cooking spices (rhizome root) using visual
        recognition and a spice library to help users learn about the spices by
        displaying their usage, characteristics, and forms using machine
        learning. This will help a beginner home cook to efficiently manage and
        organize their cooking ingredients, which leads to improving their
        knowledge about spices and the quality of their dishes.
      </p>

      <h5>Features</h5>

        <li>- Spices Library</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>App Synthesis</h5>
      <p>
        Indonesian spices are one of the endemic ingredients that are very close
        to Indonesian people and also one of the important ingredients in
        Indonesian dishes because of their benefits, such as health benefits,
        being a natural preservative, and enhancing the flavor of the dish, as
        every spice has its own unique taste and aroma.
      </p>
      <p>
        From research and interviews with beginner home cooks, it's been found
        that identifying spices can play a big role during ingredient
        preparation. Once the spices are identified, they can proceed further in
        the cooking process. One way of identifying spices is by their form and
        characteristics. According to interviews and research, visual learning
        is one of the best methods because students can respond to visual
        information faster than they can to text-only materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accuracy during identification can help them be better at correctly
        identifying the ingredients, maintaining the quality and freshness of
        the ingredients, and expediting the preparation of the ingredients.
        Hence, the quality of their dishes will improve as well.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, identifying spice difficulty can be resolved using:</p>
      <p>
        1. Visual recognition : by its form and shape
        <br />
        2. Visual information: displaying the spices' characteristics and usage
        for each dish. This will help young adults efficiently manage and
        organize their cooking ingredients, which will improve their knowledge
        about spices and the quality of their dishes.
