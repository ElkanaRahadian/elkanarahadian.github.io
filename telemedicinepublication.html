      <h5>Background</h5>
      <p>
        Telemedicine apps are commonly utilized by physicians and patients in
        the current digital era.
      </p>
      <h5>Main Problem</h5>
      <p>
        The main problem is that using various telemedicine features in daily
        practice presents many challenges for doctors. Additionally, there are
        issues with patient data needing to be integrated and issues with
        validating digital prescriptions, which may impact the degree of
        intention to use.
      </p>
      <h5>Research Aim</h5>
      <p>
        The research aims to understand and investigate how physician behavior
        and blockchain adoption affect telemedicine application usage
        intentions.
      </p>
      <h5>Methodology</h5>
      <p>
        This study employs a quantitative review methodology, multivariate
        statistical analysis, and partial least squares structural equation
        modeling (PLS-SEM). Two hundred four respondents are physicians from
        Indonesia who responded to the questionnaires distributed using Google
        Forms with the Purposive Sampling Method. The data was collected in
        April 2023.
      </p>
      <h5>Results</h5>
      <p>
        The data processing results revealed that all variables had t-values
        greater than 1.96 and ranging from 2.130 to 8.056, showing that all the
        variables, including the major variables–perceived usefulness, perceived
        ease of use, blockchain adoption, and contamination avoidance–were
        significant.
      </p>
      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
      <p>
        The results of this study indicate that doctors want to keep utilizing
        telemedicine applications since they can make it simpler to deliver
        healthcare services, are easy to use, and can be further enhanced by
        implementing blockchain technology. It showed in all six significant
        hypotheses testing.
